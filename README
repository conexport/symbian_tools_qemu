# Symbian QEmu tool
A fork of QEmu 0.9.1-1 with SymbianOS emulation support (also known as sysborg).

Original work by Symbian Foundation & contrubors.

## List of changes
- Wiped tap-win32.c as it's impossible to build due to DDK issues
- Fixed uintX_t/intX_t typedefs for newer compilers (that does supply stdint.h)
- Fixed linking of Python 2.6 64bit variant

## Requirements
- POSIX compatible system (or MinGW for Windows)
- Python 2.6

## Building
1) Configure QEMU
`./configure --target-list=arm-softmmu --with_python="your python 2.6 installation directory" --audio-drv-list="sdl" --prefix="directory where qemu should be installed"`

2) Build and install QEMU
`make install`

3) Build NVMemmory
`make -C nvmemmory` or open `nvmemmory.sln` for Visual Studio

4) Copy NVMemmory generated dynamic link library into the foldere where QEmu was installed (the one specified with --prefix)

## Running
1) Add "Source directory of QEmu/plugins" to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

2) Launch QEmu
`qemu-system-arm -M syborg.dtb -kernel SYBORGARMV5(D).img`

(NOTE: dtb and img files are not compiled or provided here)
