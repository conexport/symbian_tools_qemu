# Symbian QEMU tool
A fork of QEMU 0.9.1-1 with SymbianOS emulation support (also known as Syborg).

Original work by Symbian Foundation & contributors.

## List of changes
- Wiped tap-win32.c as it's impossible to build due to DDK issues
- Fixed uintX_t/intX_t typedefs for newer compilers (that does supply stdint.h)
- Switched to Python 2.7
- Added tcg i386 for 32-bit builds
- Fixed libnvmemmory build for newer version of Linux and Windows (both 32bit and 64bit)
- Fixed compilation for newer versions of linux sdk, gnutls, libm, librt, libpng

## Requirements
- POSIX compatible system (or MinGW for Windows)
- Python 2.7

## Building
0) Prerequisites
Install development version of:
- zlib
- libexpat
- ncruses
- SDL1
- python 2.7

1) Configure QEMU
`./configure --target-list=arm-softmmu --with-python="your python 2.7 installation directory" --audio-drv-list="sdl" --prefix="directory where qemu should be installed" --disable-kvm`

For 32-bit QEMU build on x86_64, add "--cpu=i386"


2) Build and install QEMU
`make install`

3) Build NVMemmory
`make -C nvmemmory` or open `nvmemmory.sln` for Visual Studio

4) Copy NVMemmory generated dynamic link library into the foldere where QEMU was installed (the one specified with --prefix)

## Running
1) Add "Source directory of QEMU/plugins" to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

2) Launch QEMU
`qemu-system-arm -M syborg.dtb -kernel (image file)`
